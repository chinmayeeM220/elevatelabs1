# 🗂️ Data Preprocessing & Outlier Visualization

The notebook demonstrates these steps clearly and can be used as a template for preprocessing datasets in data science projects.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- 🐍 **Python** – main programming language for data preprocessing and visualization
- 💻 **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – environment to write and run the code
- 📊 **Pandas** – for data manipulation and handling missing values
- 🔢 **NumPy** – for numerical computations and array operations
- 📈 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization and plotting boxplots to detect outliers
- 🌐 **Git & GitHub** – version control and repository to store the project

## ⚡ How I Did It
1. 🗂️ Loaded the dataset and explored basic info (nulls, data types)
2. 🔧 Handled missing values using mean/median imputation
3. 🔢 Converted categorical features to numerical using encoding
4. ⚖️ Normalized/standardized numerical features
5. 📊 Visualized and removed outliers using boxplots
6. 💾 Saved the cleaned dataset for further analysis or modeling
